Description: Provides an interface to 'vinecopulib', a C++ library for vine 
 copula modeling based on 'Boost' and 'Eigen'. The 'rvinecopulib' 
 package implements the core features of the popular 'VineCopula' package, in 
 particular inference algorithms for both vine copula and bivariate copula 
 models. Advantages over 'VineCopula' are a sleeker and more modern API, 
 improved performances, especially in high dimensions, nonparametric and 
 multi-parameter families. The 'rvinecopulib' package includes 'vinecopulib' as
 header-only C++ library (currently version 0.3.1). Thus 
 users do not need to install 'vinecopulib' itself in order to use 
 'rvinecopulib'. Since their initial releases, 'vinecopulib' is licensed under 
 the MIT License, and 'rvinecopulib' is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3.
