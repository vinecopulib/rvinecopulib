Description: 'vinecopulib' is a high performance C++ library based on
 'Boost', 'Eigen' and 'NLopt'. It provides high-performance implementations of 
 the core features of the popular VineCopula package, in particular
 inference algorithms for both vine copula and bivariate copula models.
 Advantages over VineCopula are a sleaker and more modern API, shorter runtimes, 
 especially in high dimensions, nonparametric and multi-parameter families.
