\usage{
rvine_structure(order, struct_array, is_natural_order = FALSE,
  byrow = TRUE)

rvine_matrix(matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{order}{a vector of positive integers.}

\item{struct_array}{a list of vectors of positive integers. The vectors
represent rows of the r-rvine structure and the number of elements have to
be compatible with the \code{order} vector.}

\item{is_natural_order}{whether \code{struct_array} is assumed to be provided
in natural order already (a structure is in natural order if the anti-
diagonal is 1, .., d from bottom left to top right).}

\item{byrow}{whether \code{struct_array} is assumed to be provided
by column or by row.}

\item{matrix}{an R-vine matrix, see \emph{Details}.}
}
\value{
Either an \code{rvine_structure} or an \code{rvine_matrix}.
}
\description{
R-vine structures are compressed representations encoding the tree
structure of the vine, i.e. the conditioned/conditioning
variables of each edge.
}
\details{
The R-vine structure is essentially a lower-triangular matrix/triangular array,
with a notation that differs from the one in the VineCopula package.
An example array is\preformatted{4 4 4 4
3 3 3
2 2
1
}

which encodes the following pair-copulas:

\tabular{lll}{
tree \tab  edge \tab pair-copulas   \cr
0    \tab  0    \tab \code{(1, 4)}       \cr
\tab  1    \tab \code{(2, 4)}       \cr
\tab  2    \tab \code{(3, 4)}       \cr
1    \tab  0    \tab \code{(1, 3; 2)}    \cr
\tab  1    \tab \code{(2, 3; 4)}    \cr
2    \tab  0    \tab \code{(1, 2; 3, 4)}
}

An R-vine structure can be converted to an R-vine matrix using
\code{\link[=as_rvine_matrix]{as_rvine_matrix()}}, which encodes the same model with a square matrix
filled with zeros. For instance, the matrix corresponding to the structure
above is:\preformatted{4 4 4 4
3 3 3 0
2 2 0 0
1 0 0 0
}

Similarly, an R-vine matrix can be converted to an R-vine structure using
\code{\link[=as_rvine_structure]{as_rvine_structure()}}.

Denoting by \code{M[i, j]} the array entry in row \code{i} and column \code{j} (the
pair-copula index for edge \code{e} in tree \code{t} of a \code{d} dimensional vine is
\code{(M[d - 1 - t, e], M[t, e]; M[t - 1, e], ..., M[0, e])}. Less formally,
\enumerate{
\item Start with the counter-diagonal element of column \code{e} (first conditioned
variable).
\item Jump up to the element in row \code{t} (second conditioned variable).
\item Gather all entries further up in column \code{e} (conditioning set).
}

Internally, the diagonal is stored separately from the off-diagonal elements,
which are stored as a triangular array. For instance, the off-diagonal elements
off the structure above are stored as\preformatted{4 4 4
3 3
2
}

for the structure above. The reason is that it allows for parsimonious
representations of truncated models. For instance, the 2-truncated model
is represented by the same diagonal and the following truncated triangular
array:\preformatted{4 4 4
3 3
}

A valid R-vine structure or matrix must satisfy several conditions which
are checked when \code{\link[=rvine_structure]{rvine_structure()}}, \code{\link[=rvine_matrix]{rvine_matrix()}}, or some coercion
methods (see \code{\link[=as_rvine_structure]{as_rvine_structure()}} and \code{as_rvine_matrix(}) are called:
\enumerate{
\item It can only contain numbers between 1 and d (and additionally zeros for
R-vine matrices).
\item The anti-diagonal must contain the numbers 1, ..., d.
\item The anti-diagonal entry of a column must not be contained in any
column further to the right.
\item The entries of a column must be contained in all columns to the left.
\item The proximity condition must hold: For all t = 1, ..., d - 2 and
e = 0, ..., d - t - 1 there must exist an index j > d, such that
\code{(M[t, e], {M[0, e], ..., M[t-1, e]})} equals either
\code{(M[d-j-1, j], {M[0, j], ..., M[t-1, j]})} or
\code{(M[t-1, j], {M[d-j-1, j], M[0, j], ..., M[t-2, j]})}.
}

Condition 6 already implies conditions 2-5, but is more difficult to
check by hand.
